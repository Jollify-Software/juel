# Jollify Unified/Unique Element Library (Juel)

This is a Web Component library written in TypeScript and built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/).  

## Purpose

These Web Components have been created for the [Jollify app](https://www.jollify.app) and website.  
I have decided to make this project open source in the hope that others might find these useful.

### Pro

In the future I think that these components could be extended into a Pro version which could be licensed.

## TODO

* Organisation.

* Examples/Demos.
