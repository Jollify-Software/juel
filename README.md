# Jollify Unified/Unique Element Library (Juel)

This is a Web Component library written in TypeScript and built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/).  
I think that [Bootstap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is too verbose, my component encapsulate all the markup and styles needed in one JavaScript file download.

## CDN

The Juel library can be used via CDN, just add the following script tag to your `HTML`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jollify-Software/juel/dist/juel.js"></script>
```

# Components

## Navigation

### Accordion

### Tabs

## Purpose

These Web Components have been created for the [Jollify app](https://jollify.app) and website.  
I have decided to make this project open source in the hope that others might find these useful.

### Pro & Blazor binding

In the future I think that these components could be extended into a Pro version which could be licensed.  
My app is also using the [Blazor framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) so I have created a bindings project that is used for JS interop between Blazor and my components.
