# Jollify Unified/Unique Element Library (JUEL)

This is a Web Component library written in TypeScript and built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/).  

## Purpose

In the good old days I used to create website using [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/).  
Nowadays I find myself developing applications using Web Components, so I wanted a library that offered the same kind of controls as jQueryUI but built as Web Components.

In the good old days I created a library called LuI (Luke Interface) which added a few unique components that I use on top of jQueryUI. So hence the word 'Unique' in the title, however 'Unified' makes more sense.  
so in the creation of this library I took some of the old source from my previous project and turned them into Web Components.
