                My name is Luke and I am a Software Developer based in Suffolk, England.

I have a physical disability called Cerebellum Ataxia and learning difficulties of Dyslexia and Dyscalculia (Math disability).
For a long time, I have been concerned with the mental health crisis and I believe that I am would make me a good role model and inspiration for children who may be struggling in school or face difficulties in life.

Following on from my concerns for children and education, I stood as an independent candidate in the 2024 general elections.
I will also stand in the 2025 Suffolk county elections: Campaign website

                The word ‘Jollify’ means to make something joyful, it was inspired by Jupiter: The bringer of Jollity by Gustav Holst.
So the idea is that this app will make your presentation a more joyful and pleasant experience for your audience.
The Dolphin on the logo was inspired when in 2018 NASA released a picture of a Dolphin shaped cloud on Jupiter.
