<p>I was born in Ipswich hospital in the year 1985 and I grew up in the village of Martlesham Heath near Woodbridge.<br>
Martlesham Heath is a model village that was built in the 1980s for the employees of the British Telecom research laboratories where my father worked. The village itself has a strong history as it is a former World War II airfield that was used as a testing ground for new aircraft and parts of the old runway can still be found underneath the heath.<br>
Before I started school, I attended playgroup at the old control tower, now the control tower is a museum and it is managed by the <a href="http://www.mhas.org.uk/" target="_blank">Martlesham Heath Aviation Society</a>.<br>
Another connection to history is the <a href="https://www.thedouglasbader.co.uk" target="_blank">Douglas Bader pub</a> which is named after the famous flying ace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Bader" target="_blank">Sir Douglas Bader</a>.</p>
<p>London is my ancestral home, my parents are from Surrey/South London, my father grew up in North Cheam and my mother comes from Carshalton.<br>
My mother was a physicist, she was one of the first girls in the country to study science, at a time when girls were segregated to study home economics, and she worked at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington before moving to work at the Optical Research division at British Telecom.<br>
My parents moved to Suffolk when they both transferred to new jobs at the BT Research Laboratories at Martlesham Heath.</p>
<p>My parents were keen mountaineers and birdwatchers so I spent a great deal of my childhood with nature as well as visiting Suffolk's many historic churches, this gave me a great appreciation of nature and of the details of life which are often neglected in today's society.</p>
<p>At the age of 5 I was diagnosed with Cerebellum Ataxia, this is a physical disability which affects coordination and fine motor control, as well as this I also have Dyscalculia (Mathematics disability) and Dyslexia.<br>
When I was at primary school I wore a helmet during PE lessons and I fell over often, I was not expected to achieve much in life and indeed at high school I continued to struggle, I missed several years for various reasons and when I was at school I did not use the bathroom or sometimes either eat nor drink throughout the day due to anxiety.<br>
But now I have succeeded in life and I am an example of why you mustn't judge anybody, as Shakespeare wrote, the future is the undiscovered country, you can only imagine but you have absolutely no idea what the future will be.</p>
<p>In 2007 I completed a BSc in Software Engineering, even though the degree was accredited from the University of East Anglia, I studied at (old) Suffolk College in Ipswich which meant that the tuition fees were a lot less.<br>
Since then I have been working for companies in Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds and I have become proficient in a number of programming languages.<br>
I feel very passionate about incorporating software engineering into the GCSE National Curriculum because computer programming has enabled me to have a good life and it can also enable others who are like me.</p>
<juel-accordion class=""><h2 id="why-did-you-decide-to-stand-as-an-mp" slot="title">Why did you decide to stand as an MP?</h2><div><p>I decided to stand for election because I am very concerned about the state of children's mental health and the influences on their lives.<br>
There have been a number of news reports of children committing suicide for a number of reasons: Because of exam pressures and disappointment, because of bullying and because of influence such as social media.<br>
Children are dying, they are under attack from multiple vectors and I wanted to do something about this, I wanted to prove to children that even if you have multiple disabilities like me, you can still achieve in life.</p><p>I was motivated to try and do something to help children as I read the details in these articles, all of the children who committed suicide had better lives than me and they achieved better grades than I did, so I believed that I could prove to children that if I can still achieve a successful life despite my disabilities then children have nothing to worry about.</p><p>In addition to this, I am aware that children are not the only ones to receive bullying, teachers, specifically teaching assistants can receive <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42749833" target="_blank">verbal and physical abuse</a>.<br>
I remember all the care and support I received from the teaching assistants who accompanied me throughout my school years, so this too is a very important issue that is close to me.</p></div><h2 id="what-will-you-do-if-you-are-elected" slot="title">What will you do if you are elected?</h2><div><p>If I was to enter the House of Commons, I am confident that I would be warmly welcomed and I hope that my personality would rub off on the fellow MPs who I would meet.<br>
Should I win the election, my interests would be:</p><ul>
<li>I will gather my team and design a mental health awareness and prevention campaign, this campaign will start with schools and other educational institutions in Suffolk but as mental health is a nationwide problem, this campaign must eventually have national scope.</li>
<li>I will get involved with the education select committee and recommend that and investigation into the abuse suffered by teaching assistants should be conducted, this investigation should make recommendations to parliament.</li>
<li>I will seek to push for better computer programming lessons and inclusion of Software Engineering concepts to be taught as a part of GCSE Computer Science.</li>
</ul><p>There are a number of bills that have gone or are going through parliament that are of interest to me, such as the Schools Bill and the Online Safety Bill, I shall endeavor to pick up these interests and follow their progress.</p></div><h2 id="why-join-the-sdp" slot="title">Why join the SDP?</h2><div><p>I decided to join the Social Democratic Party because I had seen some interviews with William Clouston and he seems like a calm and rational leader, he holds a degree in philosophy, the party annual conference features regular poetry readings and it seemed to me like the SDP are a good party that deserves a break and if I become an MP than that would be a breakthrough that they need.</p><p>William also describes himself as a churchgoer, which in this day and age makes him unique amongst party leaders.</p><p>Find out more by <a href="https://sdp.org.uk/" target="_blank">visiting the SDP website</a>.</p></div><h2 id="what-is-the-message-of-your-campaign" slot="title">What is the message of your campaign?</h2><div><p>The central message of my campaign is focus, there are many obsessive movements in society as well as ideas and ambitions that take people's attention away from the details, I would like to encourage people to look at the details, not just of what politicians say but indeed of what everyone says.<br>
Politicians are salesmen and when anyone sells a product or an idea then they over-simplify that which they want to sell and make the product as attractive as possible, neglecting to tell you the negatives.<br>
Politicians are not the only sellers in society, the media also wants to sell us the news, various social groups want to sell membership and there are 'influencers' on social media who want to sell their influence, even in our own lives, ambition and personal desire tempt us with ideas of a better future.</p><p>Some of these sales techniques border on lies which push ever further until the threshold is crossed, lies have become second nature and people lie without a second thought.<br>
This also has an effect on children's behavior, they see the lies in society and they question why they must be good, there have been cases of children bullying others to commit suicide and the bullies do not have any guilt.<br>
If there is no guilt for lying in society, then how can politicians be expected to tell the truth and how can children be expected to know the difference between right and wrong?<br>
With this lack of focus there is also a lack of thoughtfulness.<br>
The verb 'to conserve' means to protect, to be methodical and reasoned, this is thoughtfulness and without focus then you cannot conserve anything in your life.</p><p>For decades, politicians have been sellers who provide to the customer and the customer has been reduced into stereotypes representative groups.<br>
I believe a leader leads people in the direction that he wants to go, nobody has lead this country to where it is today, society today is the result of neglect, indifference and a lack of focus.</p><p>I promise not to get taken away with ambition or ideas but I will focus on the detail.</p></div></juel-accordion></section>
